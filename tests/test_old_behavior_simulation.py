Tests that simulate the OLD BROKEN BEHAVIOR to prove it was indeed broken.

These tests create mock providers that behave like the old code (before our fix)
and demonstrate that they would have failed to catch the HIGH-severity bug.

IMPORTANT: These tests show what WOULD HAVE HAPPENED with the old code.
They prove that our fix was necessary and actually addresses real problems.
