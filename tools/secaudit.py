"""
SECAUDIT Workflow tool - Comprehensive security audit with systematic investigation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive security assessment and analysis.
It guides the CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough security examination, vulnerability identification, and compliance assessment
before proceeding. The tool supports complex security scenarios including OWASP Top 10 coverage,
compliance framework mapping, and technology-specific security patterns.

Key features:
- Step-by-step security audit workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic security issue tracking with severity classification
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused security audits (OWASP, compliance, technology-specific)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization
- Risk-based prioritization and remediation planning
