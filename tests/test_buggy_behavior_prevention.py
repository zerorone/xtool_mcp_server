Tests that demonstrate the OLD BUGGY BEHAVIOR is now FIXED.

These tests verify that scenarios which would have incorrectly passed
before our fix now behave correctly. Each test documents the specific
bug that was fixed and what the old vs new behavior should be.

IMPORTANT: These tests PASS with our fix, but would have FAILED to catch
bugs with the old code (before list_all_known_models was implemented).
