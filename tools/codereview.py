"""
CodeReview Workflow tool - Systematic code review with step-by-step analysis

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive code review and analysis.
It guides the CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, issue identification, and quality assessment before proceeding.
The tool supports complex review scenarios including security analysis, performance evaluation,
and architectural assessment.

Key features:
- Step-by-step code review workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic issue tracking with severity classification
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused reviews (security, performance, architecture)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization

        "Describe what you're currently investigating for code review by thinking deeply about the code structure, "
        "patterns, and potential issues. In step 1, clearly state your review plan and begin forming a systematic "
        "approach after thinking carefully about what needs to be analyzed. You must begin by passing the file path "
        "for the initial code you are about to review in relevant_files. CRITICAL: Remember to thoroughly examine "
        "code quality, security implications, performance concerns, and architectural patterns. Consider not only "
        "obvious bugs and issues but also subtle concerns like over-engineering, unnecessary complexity, design "
        "patterns that could be simplified, areas where architecture might not scale well, missing abstractions, "
        "and ways to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality. Map out the codebase structure, understand "
        "the business logic, and identify areas requiring deeper analysis. In all later steps, continue exploring "
        "with precision: trace dependencies, verify assumptions, and adapt your understanding as you uncover more evidence."
