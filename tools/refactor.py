Refactor tool - Step-by-step refactoring analysis with expert validation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive code refactoring analysis.
It guides CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, refactoring opportunity identification, and quality
assessment before proceeding. The tool supports complex refactoring scenarios including
code smell detection, decomposition planning, modernization opportunities, and organization improvements.

Key features:
- Step-by-step refactoring investigation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic refactoring opportunity tracking with type and severity classification
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused refactoring types (codesmells, decompose, modernize, organization)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization with refactor completion tracking

        "organization improvements, and ways to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality. Map out the codebase "
