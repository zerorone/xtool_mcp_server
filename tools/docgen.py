"""
Documentation Generation tool - Automated code documentation with complexity analysis

This tool provides a structured workflow for adding comprehensive documentation to codebases.
It guides you through systematic code analysis to generate modern documentation with:
- Function/method parameter documentation
- Big O complexity analysis
- Call flow and dependency documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Smart updating of existing documentation

Key features:
- Step-by-step documentation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during analysis, full content for documentation)
- Automatic conversation threading and history preservation
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for multiple programming languages and documentation styles
- Configurable documentation features via parameters
