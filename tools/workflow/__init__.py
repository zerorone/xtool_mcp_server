Workflow tools for xtool MCP.

to encourage thorough investigation and analysis. They inherit from WorkflowTool
which combines BaseTool with BaseWorkflowMixin.

Available workflow tools:
- debug: Systematic investigation and root cause analysis
- planner: Sequential planning (special case - no AI calls)
- analyze: Code analysis workflow
- codereview: Code review workflow
- precommit: Pre-commit validation workflow
- refactor: Refactoring analysis workflow
- thinkdeep: Deep thinking workflow
