  <b>🤖 <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude</a> OR <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a> + [Gemini / OpenAI / Grok / OpenRouter / DIAL / Ollama / Any Model] = Your Ultimate AI Development Team</b>
</div>

<br/>

The ultimate development partners for your favorite Coding Agent ([Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) OR [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)) - a Model Context Protocol server that gives you access to multiple AI
models for enhanced code analysis, problem-solving, and collaborative development.

**Features true AI orchestration with conversations that continue across workflows** - Give Claude a complex
_workflow_ and let it orchestrate between models automatically. Claude stays in control, performs the actual work,
but gets perspectives from the best AI for each subtask. With tools like [`planner`](#3-planner---interactive-step-by-step-planning) for
breaking down complex projects, [`analyze`](#8-analyze---smart-file-analysis) for understanding codebases,
[`codereview`](#5-codereview---professional-code-review) for audits, [`refactor`](#9-refactor---intelligent-code-refactoring) for
improving code structure, [`debug`](#7-debug---expert-debugging-assistant) for solving complex problems, and [`precommit`](#6-precommit---pre-commit-validation) for
validating changes, Claude can switch between different tools _and_ models mid-conversation,
with context carrying forward seamlessly.

**Example Workflow - Claude Code:**
1. `Perform a codereview using gemini pro and o3 and use planner to generate a detailed plan, implement the fixes and do a final precommit check by continuing from the previous codereview`
2. This triggers a [`codereview`](#5-codereview---professional-code-review) workflow where Claude walks the code, looking for all kinds of issues
3. After multiple passes, collects relevant code and makes note of issues along the way
4. Maintains a `confidence` level between `exploring`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and `certain` to track how confidently it's been able to find and identify issues
5. Generates a detailed list of critical -> low issues
6. Shares the relevant files, findings, etc with **Gemini Pro** to perform a deep dive for a second [`codereview`](#5-codereview---professional-code-review)
7. Comes back with a response and next does the same with o3, adding to the prompt if a new discovery comes to light
8. When done, Claude takes in all the feedback and combines a single list of all critical -> low issues, including good patterns in your code. The final list includes new findings or revisions in case Claude misunderstood or missed something crucial and one of the other models pointed this out
9. It then uses the [`planner`](#3-planner---interactive-step-by-step-planning) workflow to break the work down into simpler steps if a major refactor is required
10. Claude then performs the actual work of fixing highlighted issues
11. When done, Claude returns to Gemini Pro for a [`precommit`](#6-precommit---pre-commit-validation) review

All within a single conversation thread! Gemini Pro in step 11 _knows_ what was recommended by O3 in step 7! Taking that context
and review into consideration to aid with its final pre-commit review.

**Think of it as Claude Code _for_ Claude Code.** This MCP isn't magic. It's just **super-glue**.

> **Remember:** Claude stays in full control — but **YOU** call the shots.
> Zen is designed to have Claude engage other models only when needed — and to follow through with meaningful back-and-forth.
> **You're** the one who crafts the powerful prompt that makes Claude bring in Gemini, Flash, O3 — or fly solo.
> You're the guide. The prompter. The puppeteer.
> ### You are the AI - **Actually Intelligent**.

## Why This Server?

Claude is brilliant, but sometimes you need:
- **Guided workflows** - Developer-centric processes that enforce systematic investigation, preventing rushed analysis by ensuring Claude examines code thoroughly at each phase ([`debug`](#7-debug---expert-debugging-assistant), [`precommit`](#6-precommit---pre-commit-validation), [`refactor`](#9-refactor---intelligent-code-refactoring), [`analyze`](#8-analyze---smart-file-analysis), [`codereview`](#5-codereview---professional-code-review))
- **Multiple AI perspectives** - Let Claude orchestrate between different models to get the best analysis
- **Automatic model selection** - Claude picks the right model for each task (or you can specify)
- **A senior developer partner** to validate and extend ideas ([`chat`](#1-chat---general-development-chat--collaborative-thinking))
- **A second opinion** on complex architectural decisions - augment Claude's thinking with perspectives from Gemini Pro, O3, or [dozens of other models via custom endpoints](docs/custom_models.md) ([`thinkdeep`](#2-thinkdeep---extended-reasoning-partner))
- **Get multiple expert opinions** - Have different AI models debate your ideas (some supporting, some critical) to help you make better decisions ([`consensus`](#3-consensus---multi-model-perspective-gathering))
- **Professional code reviews** with actionable feedback across entire repositories ([`codereview`](#4-codereview---professional-code-review))
- **Pre-commit validation** with deep analysis using the best model for the job ([`precommit`](#5-precommit---pre-commit-validation))
- **Expert debugging** - O3 for logical issues, Gemini for architectural problems ([`debug`](#6-debug---expert-debugging-assistant))
- **Extended context windows beyond Claude's limits** - Delegate analysis to Gemini (1M tokens) or O3 (200K tokens) for entire codebases, large datasets, or comprehensive documentation
- **Model-specific strengths** - Extended thinking with Gemini Pro, fast iteration with Flash, strong reasoning with O3, local privacy with Ollama
- **Local model support** - Run models like Llama 3.2 locally via Ollama, vLLM, or LM Studio for privacy and cost control
- **Dynamic collaboration** - Models can request additional context and follow-up replies from Claude mid-analysis
- **Smart file handling** - Automatically expands directories, manages token limits based on model capacity
- **Vision support** - Analyze images, diagrams, screenshots, and visual content with vision-capable models
- **[Bypass MCP's token limits](docs/advanced-usage.md#working-with-large-prompts)** - Work around MCP's 25K limit automatically
- **[Context revival across sessions](docs/context-revival.md)** - Continue conversations even after Claude's context resets, with other models maintaining full history

## Pro Tip: Context Revival

**This is an extremely powerful feature that cannot be highlighted enough**:

> The most amazing side-effect of this _conversation continuation_ system is that even AFTER Claude's context resets or
> compacts, since the continuation info is kept within MCP's memory, you can ask it to _continue_ discussing
> the plan with `o3`, and it will suddenly revive Claude because O3 would know what was being talked about and
> relay this back in a way that re-ignites Claude's understanding. All this without wasting context on asking Claude to
> ingest lengthy documents / code again and re-prompting it to communicate with another model. Zen manages that internally. The model's response
> revives Claude with better context around the discussion than an automatic summary ever can.

**[📖 Read the complete technical deep-dive on how this revolutionary system works](docs/context-revival.md)**

This server orchestrates multiple AI models as your development team, with Claude automatically selecting the best model for each task or allowing you to choose specific models for different strengths.

**Prompt Used:**
```
Study the code properly, think deeply about what this does and then see if there's any room for improvement in
terms of performance optimizations, brainstorm with gemini on this to get feedback and then confirm any change by
first adding a unit test with `measure` and measuring current code and then implementing the optimization and
measuring again to ensure it improved, then share results. Check with gemini in between as you make tweaks.
```

The final implementation resulted in a 26% improvement in JSON parsing performance for the selected library, reducing processing time through targeted, collaborative optimizations guided by Gemini’s analysis and Claude’s refinement.

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (3.12 recommended)
- Git
- **Windows users**: WSL2 is required for Claude Code CLI

### 1. Get API Keys (at least one required)

**Option A: OpenRouter (Access multiple models with one API)**
- **OpenRouter**: Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for access to multiple models through one API. [Setup Guide](docs/custom_models.md)
  - Control model access and spending limits directly in your OpenRouter dashboard
  - Configure model aliases in [`conf/custom_models.json`](conf/custom_models.json)

**Option B: Native APIs**
- **Gemini**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key. For best results with Gemini 2.5 Pro, use a paid API key as the free tier has limited access to the latest models.
- **OpenAI**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to get an API key for O3 model access.
- **X.AI**: Visit [X.AI Console](https://console.x.ai/) to get an API key for GROK model access.
- **DIAL**: Visit [DIAL Platform](https://dialx.ai/) to get an API key for accessing multiple models through their unified API. DIAL is an open-source AI orchestration platform that provides vendor-agnostic access to models from major providers, open-source community, and self-hosted deployments. [API Documentation](https://dialx.ai/dial_api)

**Option C: Custom API Endpoints (Local models like Ollama, vLLM)**
[Please see the setup guide](docs/custom_models.md#option-2-custom-api-setup-ollama-vllm-etc). With a custom API you can use:
- **Ollama**: Run models like Llama 3.2 locally for free inference
- **vLLM**: Self-hosted inference server for high-throughput inference
- **LM Studio**: Local model hosting with OpenAI-compatible API interface
- **Text Generation WebUI**: Popular local interface for running models
- **Any OpenAI-compatible API**: Custom endpoints for your own infrastructure

> **Note:** Using multiple provider options may create ambiguity about which provider / model to use if there is an overlap.
> If all APIs are configured, native APIs will take priority when there is a clash in model name, such as for `gemini` and `o3`.
> Configure your model aliases and give them unique names in [`conf/custom_models.json`](conf/custom_models.json)

### 2. Choose Your Installation Method

**Option A: Quick Install with uvx**

**Prerequisites**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first (required for uvx)

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop Configuration</summary>

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zen": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "exec $(which uvx || echo uvx) --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/xtool_mcp_server.git xtool_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:~/.local/bin",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code CLI Configuration</summary>

Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root for [project-scoped configuration](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#project-scope):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zen": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "exec $(which uvx || echo uvx) --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/xtool_mcp_server.git xtool_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:~/.local/bin",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Gemini CLI Configuration</summary>

Edit `~/.gemini/settings.json` and add:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zen": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "exec $(which uvx || echo uvx) --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/xtool_mcp_server.git xtool_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:~/.local/bin",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: While xtool MCP Server connects successfully to Gemini CLI, tool invocation is not working correctly yet. See [Gemini CLI Setup](docs/gemini-setup.md) for updates.
</details>

**What this does:**
- **Zero setup required** - uvx handles everything automatically
- **Always up-to-date** - Pulls latest version on each run
- **No local dependencies** - Works without Python environment setup
- **Instant availability** - Ready to use immediately


**Option B: Traditional Clone and Set Up**

```bash
# Clone to your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/xtool_mcp_server.git
cd xtool_mcp_server

# One-command setup installs Zen in Claude
build/scripts/run-server.sh

# Or for Windows users using PowerShell:
./run-server.ps1

# To view MCP configuration for Claude
build/scripts/run-server.sh -c

# PowerShell:
./run-server.ps1 -Config

# See help for more
build/scripts/run-server.sh --help

# PowerShell:
./run-server.ps1 -Help
```

**What this does:**
- **Sets up everything automatically** - Python environment, dependencies, configuration
- **Configures Claude integrations** - Adds to Claude Code CLI and guides Desktop setup
- **Ready to use immediately** - No manual configuration needed
- **Also works with Gemini CLI** - See [Gemini CLI Setup](docs/gemini-setup.md) for configuration

**After updates:** Always run `build/scripts/run-server.sh` again after `git pull` to ensure everything stays current.

**Windows users:** Using WSL? See the [WSL Setup Guide](docs/wsl-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Add Your API Keys

```bash
# Edit .env to add your API keys (if not already set in environment)
nano .env

# The file will contain, at least one should be set:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here  # For Gemini models
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here  # For O3 model
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key  # For OpenRouter (see docs/custom_models.md)
# DIAL_API_KEY=your-dial-api-key-here      # For DIAL platform

# For DIAL (optional configuration):
# DIAL_API_HOST=https://core.dialx.ai      # Default DIAL host (optional)
# DIAL_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview      # API version (optional)
# DIAL_ALLOWED_MODELS=o3,gemini-2.5-pro    # Restrict to specific models (optional)

# For local models (Ollama, vLLM, etc.):
# CUSTOM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1  # Ollama example
# CUSTOM_API_KEY=                                      # Empty for Ollama
# CUSTOM_MODEL_NAME=llama3.2                          # Default model

# Note: At least one API key OR custom URL is required
```

**No restart needed**: The server reads the .env file each time Claude calls a tool, so changes take effect immediately.

**Next**: Now run `claude` from your project folder using the terminal for it to connect to the newly added mcp server.
If you were already running a `claude` code session, please exit and start a new session.

#### If Setting up for Claude Desktop

**Need the exact configuration?** Run `build/scripts/run-server.sh -c` to display the platform-specific setup instructions with correct paths.

1. **Open Claude Desktop config**: Settings → Developer → Edit Config
2. **Copy the configuration** shown by `build/scripts/run-server.sh -c` into your `claude_desktop_config.json`
3. **Restart Claude Desktop** for changes to take effect

### 4. Start Using It!

Just ask Claude naturally:
- "Think deeper about this architecture design with zen" → Claude picks best model + `thinkdeep`
- "Using zen perform a code review of this code for security issues" → Claude might pick Gemini Pro + `codereview`
- "Use zen and debug why this test is failing, the bug might be in my_class.swift" → Claude might pick O3 + `debug`
- "With zen, analyze these files to understand the data flow" → Claude picks appropriate model + `analyze`
- "Use flash to suggest how to format this code based on the specs mentioned in policy.md" → Uses Gemini Flash specifically
- "Think deeply about this and get o3 to debug this logic error I found in the checkOrders() function" → Uses O3 specifically
- "Brainstorm scaling strategies with pro. Study the code, pick your preferred strategy and debate with pro to settle on two best approaches" → Uses Gemini Pro specifically
- "Use local-llama to localize and add missing translations to this project" → Uses local Llama 3.2 via custom URL
- "First use local-llama for a quick local analysis, then use opus for a thorough security review" → Uses both providers in sequence

## Available Tools

These aren't just tools—they're how you get Claude to think like a real developer. Instead of rushing to reply with
surface-level takes or shallow-insight, these workflows make Claude pause, dig into your code, and reason through
problems step by step.

It's the difference between a rushed guess and a focused second pair of eyes that actually understands your code. Try them
and feel the difference.

**Quick Tool Selection Guide:**
- **Need a thinking partner?** → `chat` (brainstorm ideas, get second opinions, validate approaches)
- **Need deeper thinking?** → `thinkdeep` (extends analysis, finds edge cases)
- **Want to prevent "You're absolutely right!" responses?** → `challenge` (challenges assumptions, encourages thoughtful re-evaluation)
- **Need to break down complex projects?** → `planner` (step-by-step planning, project structure, breaking down complex ideas)
- **Need multiple perspectives?** → `consensus` (get diverse expert opinions on proposals and decisions)
- **Code needs review?** → `codereview` (bugs, security, performance issues)
- **Pre-commit validation?** → `precommit` (validate git changes before committing)
- **Something's broken?** → `debug` (systematic investigation, step-by-step root cause analysis)
- **Want to understand code?** → `analyze` (architecture, patterns, dependencies)
- **Code needs refactoring?** → `refactor` (intelligent refactoring with decomposition focus)
- **Need call-flow analysis?** → `tracer` (generates prompts for execution tracing and dependency mapping)
- **Need comprehensive tests?** → `testgen` (generates test suites with edge cases)
- **Security concerns?** → `secaudit` (OWASP analysis, compliance evaluation, vulnerability assessment)
- **Code needs documentation?** → `docgen` (generates comprehensive documentation with complexity analysis)
- **Which models are available?** → `listmodels` (shows all configured providers and models)
- **Server info?** → `version` (version and configuration details)

**Auto Mode:** When `DEFAULT_MODEL=auto`, Claude automatically picks the best model for each task. You can override with: "Use flash for quick analysis" or "Use o3 to debug this".

**Model Selection Examples:**
- Complex architecture review → Claude picks Gemini Pro
- Quick formatting check → Claude picks Flash
- Logical debugging → Claude picks O3
- General explanations → Claude picks Flash for speed
- Local analysis → Claude picks your Ollama model

**Pro Tip:** Thinking modes (for Gemini models) control depth vs token cost. Use "minimal" or "low" for quick tasks, "high" or "max" for complex problems. [Learn more](docs/advanced-usage.md#thinking-modes)

### 1. `chat` - General Development Chat & Collaborative Thinking
Your thinking partner for brainstorming, getting second opinions, and validating approaches. Perfect for technology comparisons, architecture discussions, and collaborative problem-solving.

```
Chat with zen about the best approach for user authentication in my React app
```

**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/chat.md)** - Detailed features, examples, and best practices

### 2. `thinkdeep` - Extended Reasoning Partner
Get a second opinion to augment Claude's own extended thinking. Uses specialized thinking models to challenge assumptions, identify edge cases, and provide alternative perspectives.

```
The button won't animate when clicked, it seems something else is intercepting the clicks. Use thinkdeep with gemini pro after gathering related code and handing it the files
and find out what the root cause is
```

**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/thinkdeep.md)** - Enhanced analysis capabilities and critical evaluation process

### 3. `challenge` - Critical Challenge Prompt
Encourages thoughtful reassessment of statements instead of automatic agreement, especially when you're wrong.
Wraps your input with instructions for critical thinking and honest analysis.

```
challenge isn't adding this function to the base class a bad idea?
```

Normally, your favorite coding agent will enthusiastically reply with **“You’re absolutely right!”**—then proceed 
to completely reverse the _correct_ strategy, without ever explaining why you're wrong.

**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/challenge.md)** - Challenge an approach or validate ideas with confidence

### 4. `planner` - Interactive Step-by-Step Planning
Break down complex projects or ideas into manageable, structured plans through step-by-step thinking.
Perfect for adding new features to an existing system, scaling up system design, migration strategies,
and architectural planning with branching and revision capabilities.

#### Pro Tip
Claude supports `sub-tasks` where it will spawn and run separate background tasks. You can ask Claude to
run Zen's planner with two separate ideas. Then when it's done, use Zen's `consensus` tool to pass the entire
plan and get expert perspective from two powerful AI models on which one to work on first! Like performing **AB** testing
in one-go without the wait!

```
Create two separate sub-tasks: in one, using planner tool show me how to add natural language support
to my cooking app. In the other sub-task, use planner to plan how to add support for voice notes to my cooking app.
Once done, start a consensus by sharing both plans to o3 and flash to give me the final verdict. Which one do
I implement first?
```

**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/planner.md)** - Step-by-step planning methodology and multi-session continuation

### 5. `consensus` - Multi-Model Perspective Gathering
Get diverse expert opinions from multiple AI models on technical proposals and decisions. Supports stance steering (for/against/neutral) and structured decision-making.

```
Get a consensus with flash taking a supportive stance and gemini pro being critical to evaluate whether we should
migrate from REST to GraphQL for our API. I need a definitive answer.
```

**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/consensus.md)** - Multi-model orchestration and decision analysis

### 6. `codereview` - Professional Code Review
Comprehensive code analysis with prioritized feedback and severity levels. This workflow tool guides Claude through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure thorough code examination, issue identification, and quality assessment before providing expert analysis.

```
Perform a codereview with gemini pro especially the auth.py as I feel some of the code is bypassing security checks
and there may be more potential vulnerabilities. Find and share related code."
```

**Tips**:
* To avoid extra API costs, add `do not use another model` to run the entire codereview workflow locally.
* If you want to **always** consult an external model (recommended for code reviews) regardless of Claude’s confidence level in identifying issues, use `must codereview using <model name>`. This ensures the model is consulted even if Claude is _certain_ about identified issues.


**[📖 Read More](docs/tools/codereview.md)** - Professional review workflow with step-by-step analysis

### 7. `precommit` - Pre-Commit Validation
Comprehensive review of staged/unstaged git changes across multiple repositories. This workflow tool guides Claude through systematic investigation of git changes, repository status, and file modifications across multiple steps before providing expert validation to ensure changes meet requirements and prevent regressions.

```
Perform a thorough precommit with o3, we want to only highlight critical issues, no blockers, no regressions. I need
100% confidence this covers all the edge cases listed in FIX_ISSUE_ABC.md
```

#### Real Example:

* I asked claude (sonnet-4) to refactor some code to fix a known bug; gave it exact instructions
* The fix looked correct — and at a glance, so did the changes.
* More importantly, all existing unit tests passed (540+ unit tests) without a hitch. Zero regressions. Claude seemed confident and eager to commit. Everything looked perfect.

I then ran:

```text
Run a precommit with o3 confirm our changes are sound and diffs are valid. Confirm this won't cause breakage or
regressions and codesmells are out
```

This passed the tracked and untracked changes / diffs and the related code to o3 for a thorough review via Zen's `precommit` tool.

Output:

```text
⏺ Precommit Analysis Results - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

  The O3 model has identified one HIGH-severity regression and several medium/low issues in our refactor. Here's the summary:

  🚨 HIGH SEVERITY - MUST FIX BEFORE COMMIT

  ...
```

The reported issue was in fact a _very subtle bug_ that slipped through the quick glance — and a unit test for this exact case apparently
was missing (out of 540 existing tests!) - explains the zero reported regressions. The fix was ultimately simple, but the
fact Claude (and by extension, I) overlooked this, was a stark reminder: no number of eyeballs is ever enough. Fixed the
issue, ran `precommit` with o3 again and got:

 **RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH COMMIT**

Nice! This is just one instance - take a look at [another example here](docs/tools/precommit.md).

**Tips**:
* To avoid extra API costs, add `do not use another model` to run the entire precommit workflow locally.
* If you want to **always** consult an external model (recommended for pre-commit analysis) regardless of Claude’s confidence level in identifying issues, use `must precommit using <model name>`. This ensures the model is consulted even if Claude is _certain_ about identified issues.

### 8. `debug` - Expert Debugging Assistant
Systematic investigation-guided debugging that walks Claude through step-by-step root cause analysis. This workflow 
tool enforces a structured investigation process where Claude performs methodical code examination, evidence collection, 
and hypothesis formation across multiple steps before receiving expert analysis from the selected AI model. When Claude's 
confidence reaches **100% certainty** during the investigative workflow, expert analysis via another model is skipped to 
save on tokens and cost, and Claude proceeds directly to fixing the issue. 

```
See logs under /Users/me/project/diagnostics.log and related code under the sync folder.
Logs show that sync works but sometimes it gets stuck and there are no errors displayed to
the user. Using zen's debug tool with gemini pro, find out why this is happening and what the root
cause is and its fix
```

**Tips**:
* To avoid extra API costs, add `do not use another model` to run the entire debugging workflow locally. This is recommended in most cases, as Claude typically identifies the root cause with high confidence by the end.
* If you want to **always** consult an external model regardless of Claude’s confidence level, use `must debug using <model name>`. This ensures the model is consulted even if Claude is _certain_ about the issue.

When in doubt, you can always follow up with a new prompt and ask Claude to share its findings with another model:

```text
Use continuation with thinkdeep, share details with o4-mini to find out what the best fix is for this
```
