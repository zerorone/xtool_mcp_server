"""
TestGen Workflow tool - Step-by-step test generation with expert validation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive test generation.
It guides the CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, test planning, and pattern identification before proceeding.
The tool supports backtracking, finding updates, and expert analysis integration for
comprehensive test suite generation.

Key features:
- Step-by-step test generation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic test pattern detection and framework identification
- Expert analysis integration with external models for additional test suggestions
- Support for edge case identification and comprehensive coverage
- Confidence-based workflow optimization
